"15","Twitter says it will comply with Honest Ads Act to combat Russia social media meddling","Twitter today pledged to support a proposed Senate bill that would require technology platforms that sell advertising space to disclose the source of and amount of money paid for political ads. Called the Honest Ads Act, the bipartisan bill was first introduced back in October by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). The regulation of online political advertisements is one of the lasting, material effects of Russian interference in the 2016 US election, in which thousands of fake Kremlin-linked accounts were used to plant propaganda, sow distrust, and stir up heated debates on divisive political issues among the American populace primarily through social media.
Twitter is following in the footsteps of Facebook, which said last week that it would make critical changes to its political ad policies amid the ongoing Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal to reduce misinformation and prevent bad actors from co-opting its platform. Those changes, in compliance with the Honest Ads Act, include requiring advertisers targeting Facebook users over hot-button political issues like gun control to verify their identity and location. Ads will also be subject to a â€œpolitical adâ€ label. A mix of human moderators and artificial intelligence-powered algorithms will scan the site to flag ads that require the label. Sens. Klobuchar and Warner called on Google and Twitter to commit to the Honest Ads Act just yesterday in the wake of Facebookâ€™s announcement.","3.jpg","image/jpeg","../../blog_photos/thumbnail/3.jpg","../../blog_photos/main/twitter.jpg","2018-04-10","Social"
"16","Google removes original Pixel and Pixel XL from its online store","Googleâ€™s original Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, the beginning of the companyâ€™s broader push to unify and streamline its in-house hardware efforts, have been removed from the online Google Store, as noted today by AndroidPolice. Google confirmed to The Verge that the devices are no longer available for purchase from the company directly. You can, however, still purchase the original Pixel and Pixel XL devices in a variety of colors and storage sizes from places like Amazon and Best Buy.
It makes sense Google would eventually remove the original Pixel phones, as last yearâ€™s Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have replaced them. But as devices that originally rivaled Appleâ€™s iPhone and Samsungâ€™s Galaxy line in price, it was always refreshing to know you could buy a brand-new original Pixel at a discount now that the devices have been out for about a year and a half. So, if youâ€™re in the market for an older Android flagship that can still reasonably hold its own against most other phones in its price range â€” the original Pixel goes for about $399 new or $299 refurbished â€” itâ€™d be wise to snatch one up from Amazon before it becomes harder to find.","2.jpg","image/jpeg","../../blog_photos/thumbnail/2.jpg","../../blog_photos/main/pixels.jpg","2018-04-10","Technology"

"18","Google Home and Home Mini are now available in India","Google has announced availability of the Google Home and Home Mini in India today. The smart speakers are exclusive to Flipkart for now, with the regular Google Home priced at â‚¹9,999 (about $154) and the Mini selling for â‚¹4,999 (about $77). The Mini is available in black or white; the Home only comes in white. Buying either gets you six free months of Google Play Music.
Although the Google Assistant can already be used in Hindi on phones, Android Central reports that Hindi support will only roll out to the Google Home speakers â€œlater this year.â€ The official India launch does, however, mean Google now natively supports Indian music services like Saavn and Gaana.

"19","This cheap 3D-printed home is a start for the 1 billion who lack shelter","Food, water, and shelter are basic human needs, but 1.2 billion people in the world live without adequate housing, according to a report by the World Resources Instituteâ€™s Ross Center for Sustainable Cities. Today at SXSW, an Austin-based startup will unveil its approach to combat that deficiency by using low-cost 3D printing as a potential solution.
ICON has developed a method for printing a single-story 650-square-foot house out of cement in only 12 to 24 hours, a fraction of the time it takes for new construction. If all goes according to plan, a community made up of about 100 homes will be constructed for residents in El Salvador next year. The company has partnered with New Story, a nonprofit that is vested in international housing solutions.","house1.jpg","image/jpeg","../../blog_photos/thumbnail/house1.jpg","../../blog_photos/main/house2.jpg","2018-04-11","Design"
"20","SAMSUNG NOTEBOOK 9 PRO REVIEW: PLASTIC AND PENS","When it comes to the Notebook 9 Pro, Samsung thinks sharing is caring. Available in both 13 and 15-inch versions, theyâ€™re equipped with most of the same core specs. That means Core i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, 128 / 256 / 512GB SSD storage options, and HDR-supporting 1080p LED panels. Internally, the only exclusive spec is for the 15-inch version, in the form of a low-end Radeon 540 discrete graphics chip. The 13-inch model starts at $949, while the 15-inch version tested costs $1,299.
But hereâ€™s the kicker on why Samsung is adding the â€œProâ€ moniker: both laptops come with an S Pen, laden with both Windows Ink and Samsungâ€™s Air Command. In some way, itâ€™s an extension of Samsungâ€™s family, with long-time Galaxy Note users being all too familiar with the ways of their new laptopâ€™s stylus. It also speaks to the trend with Windows laptops this year: almost everywhere you look, pen support is getting added. Windows 10 has also gotten a number of updates to better support pens this year, most notably with the Creatorâ€™s Update that arrived this spring.
New Samsung customers never exposed to the S Pen will have the option of a revered input tool. According to Samsung, this particular version of the S Pen is the same seen on the Note 8 â€” 0.7mm tip, 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity â€” with the only difference being a unique plastic casing used to fit the Notebook 9â€™s chassis and curvature.","samsung1.jpg","image/jpeg","../../blog_photos/thumbnail/samsung1.jpg","../../blog_photos/main/samsung2.jpg","2018-04-11","Technology"
